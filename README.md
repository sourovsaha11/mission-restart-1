1. The difference between null and undefined is ,
null happen when we set the value equal null. like {const value = null}.and undefined happen when we do not set the value and console.log the variable . like { const a; console.log(a)}.this is the main difference between null and undefined.

2.The use of the map is ,
We use map when we wants to itarate the loop and go to each and every element and manipulate them as we want . so basically we change the items and it also give us a new array ,so it returns . but in forEach case it can not return any array or items . so we just can travel and iterate through the items but it can not give us new product .

3.difference between == and === is huge. in (==) it can not check the data type so '1' == 1 is true. but (===) it check the data type also .so '1' === 1 is false . it is always good to use (===) every where so that we can avoid bug .

4.without async/await code become messy . sometimes .then chain become hard to see what happen in the code and sometimes we can see deadlock also. so because of clean code and debugging we should use async/await. then only code looks clean and good to read.

5.if we use variable in global scope then we can use that variable from any where in the code but if we use variable in a function scope that time we just can access it from the function .outside of the function we can not use it .and the last one block scope is when we use {} and inner that we use variable . that time we can access it from inside of the {} bracket .so this is the difference between global scope, functional scope and block scope . In every loop like for ,while we use block scope.
